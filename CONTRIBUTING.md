# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution! Keep it simple.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## PR process

1. Branch off `main`, keep changes focused.
2. Add a test for any behavior change.
3. Green checks: `pytest` + typecheck.
4. Fill in the PR template — one paragraph on what and why.
5. CI green = merge.

## Structure

Keep it boring: small modules, clear names, no premature abstraction.
